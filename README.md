# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
3rd project from The Odin Project made by Bryce Berdijo

January 7 (morning) - Today is the start of my 2nd semester in MIS. I will be a little slower than I once was because of that. I will log my full ideas, plans and thoughts here as a way to remember what I did. So far, I have created the HTML and javascript file. I plan on attempting to create the functions for the game and possibly some UI elements on the website. Wish me luck.

January 7 (11:06pm) - I have finished working on script.js, which means I have made my own rock, paper, scissors game. I have decided not to push with adding in GUI or any other fancy stuff. Just a scoreboard and seeing the computer's option in advance would be fine. I might revisit this soon but for now, I will submit this into The Odin Project. (P.S. For those reading this, yes, I am a college student in my first year in MIS. I know, I'm not a sexy CS major or whatever)
