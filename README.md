# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
3rd project from The Odin Project made by Bryce Berdijo

January 7 - Today is the start of my 2nd semester in MIS. I will be a little slower than I once was because of that. I will log my full ideas, plans and thoughts here as a way to remember what I did. So far, I have created the HTML and javascript file. I plan on attempting to create the functions for the game and possibly some UI elements on the website. Wish me luck.
